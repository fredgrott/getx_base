# ARCHITECTURE

The gist is that I am using a layer domain-driven-development architecture setup.

## SetUp

The setup of the lib-folder:

-presentation is the views and controllers

-domain is the business entity objects

-data is the repository objects

-application is the app infrastructure objects
